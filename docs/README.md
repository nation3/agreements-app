## Introduction

Nation3 Court allows the creation of agreements between two or more non-trusted parties that are arbitrable by a trusted third party in the case of a dispute.

> A contract is a legally enforceable agreement that creates, defines, and governs mutual rights and obligations among its parties.

While standard smart contracts can guarantee their enforceability by a built-in mechanism defined by code, they usually fall short of the flexibility or complexity required to resolve complex & subjective human-based disputes.

To resolve complex human-based disputes is required to build complex human-based oracles, such as:

- [Aragon Court](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-court)
- [Kleros](https://github.com/kleros)

While being fascinating peer-to-peer arbitration systems that can be effectively used for use-cases such as content moderation, public proof verification, and similar, these human oracles fail to fully enable the potential of a system of law.

In contrast to these projects, Nation3 Court does not aim to be a fully decentralized protocol but a standard to build DAO-centric jurisdictions, where the arbitration power is delegated to one or more trusted decentralized organizations.

## Nation3 Court fundamentals

The fundamental primitives of this system are:
- Arbitrable agreements
- Arbitration system

An arbitrable agreement is a contract between two or more parties backed by a set of on-chain assets, enforceable through a bound smart contract, and disputable through an arbitration system.

The arbitration system is a set of on-chain procedures to resolve disputes and enforce those resolutions in its arbitrated agreements. The DAO owns the arbitration power and can appoint a court of jurors to operate it.

## DAO-centric Jurisdiction

The authority to enforce rulings in the system extends to all assets arbitrated by the system, thus defining its jurisdiction. The higher authority in the system is the DAO which owns and operates the system.

When a new agreement is created, the joining parties opt-in to the DAO jurisdiction by depositing new assets under the system's arbitration, extending its authority.

The trust in the DAO will define the grade in which users will opt-in to its jurisdiction. And the confidence in the DAO itself will be heavily impacted by how well it can operate this arbitration system.

As more value enters the system's jurisdiction, the DAO can capture more value from it. So, the DAO is incentivized to maintain and even improve the trust in the system.
